        <p>The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is based on the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. The film stars Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, a banker who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murder of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence. Over the course of the film, he befriends fellow prisoner Ellis "Red" Redding (played by Morgan Freeman) and finds hope and redemption through acts of common decency.</p>
